Dear Manager,

This email provides a summary of today's progress on the project.

**Project Progress:**

We completed the user authentication module (100%), implemented dashboard functionality (85%), fixed twelve critical bugs in the payment system, and updated the API documentation.

We are experiencing database performance issues during peak hours and the integration testing is delayed due to third-party API limitations.  We also require additional resources for mobile app development.

**Next Steps:**

Our next steps include optimizing database queries, implementing a caching layer, scheduling a meeting with the mobile development team next week, and preparing a presentation for the stakeholder review.

**Performance Metrics:**

* Code coverage: 92%
* User satisfaction: 4.7/5
* System performance: 95% of SLA targets met
